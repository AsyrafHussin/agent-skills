Each rule includes detailed explanations with bad vs. good code examples, TypeScript patterns, and specific use cases. Covers server state with React Query (data fetching, caching, mutations, optimistic updates) and client state with Zustand (stores, persistence, selectors). Optimized for automated refactoring and state management best practices.",
